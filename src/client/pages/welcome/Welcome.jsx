            What makes us unique? It isn’t our beliefs. We affirm the same basic Christian doctrines that have been a part of the Church for hundreds of years. Rather, we are committed to presenting these truths in a practical, relevant, contemporary, and loving manner. Our desire is to introduce you to Jesus Christ and to help you grow and become a kingdom worker. We want to help you to become a kingdom worker who can influence the world around you with the love of Jesus Christ.
            <br/> <br/>
            Our church is comprised of a network of “family groups“; small group settings where honest friendships, Bible study, constant prayer, and compassionate care are emphasized. It is within these dynamic family groups where the core of our evangelism and discipleship take place. We invite you to become of a part of these contagious Christian communities that strive to influence and encourage one another.
            <br/> <br/>
            Again, whether you’re a spiritual seeker who’s just starting to ask questions about God, or a committed Christian who wants to sink the roots of your faith even deeper, you can find a home here at Grace Covenant Church.
            <br/> <br/>
